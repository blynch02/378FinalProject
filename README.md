Title: Duskhold!

Description: 

Team Members: Garrett Reinhard, Jared Hammett, Braedon Lynch, Abi Muthu

Game Idea:
We are planning on making a turn based battle game that is similar to Darkest Dungeon. The player will control a party of three heroes that have unique strengths and abilities that must be used to progress through waves of combat.

Closest Genre: RPG -> darkest dungeon, turn based, defeat waves of enemies.

Game parts/loop:
1. One continuous scene.
2. Party of 3, mobs also max 3
3. Wave based, on start, you have a set number of base characters - empty inventory
Basic equipment
One or two attacks
Special aura or ability for the class of the character
4. 10 waves max -> progressively scaled
5. On end turn: level ups and dropped equipment that is gained after each wave.
6. End of game: all characters die, or make it through the dungeon. 

Technical challenges:
AI

Assets Plan:

Character Classes:
Healer/Paladin (Weak attacks, support role, buffs party)
Knight (Heavy single target damage dealer)
Wizard (Ranged attacks/ status effects, low damage/status afflicting AOE attacks)
Jester (status effect giver, taunts, get enemies to attack each other)
Assassin (ranged with a crossbow, throwing knives or equivalent, can go invisible, can execute enemies)
Animations:
Environments: 
Menus:
Music/Sound Effects:

Art style: pixel based, for characters and background. Maybe the background is animated slightly.

Core Mechanic: In depth combat system, with status effects, positive & negative modifiers that affect combat. Enemies will be formidable, every encounter should feel rewarding to get through.
